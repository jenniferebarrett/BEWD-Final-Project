For my final project I'd like to create a web app takes two coordinates and returns driving directions as well a list of the highest rated points of interest at any given point in the journey.  The driving instructions will be generated using Google Maps API and the list of points of interest will be generated using user inputted search terms and the Yelp Search API. Users will be able to save and delete routes and add comments for later use.

User Stories:

1. As a visiting/authenticated user, I can search for a route and view the results of my search
2. As an authenticated user, I save the results of my search
3. As an authenticated user, I can see saved results from previous searches
4. As an authenicated user, I can add comments to routes and save them to my library
5. As a visiting user I can create an account.
6. As an authenticated user who is not logged in, I can log in to my account.
